# In-Vivo-Nano-Networks
The advances in nanotechnology over the past few years have paved the path for cutting-edge healthcare networks, including In-vivo Wireless Nanosensor Networks (iWNSNs). These networks provide sensing, coordination, and control among their constituents and autonomous data transfer. Thus are anticipated to make a wide variety of applications ranging from drug delivery systems to intra-body health monitoring. Numerous propagation models have been developed in the past few years to examine and analyze the feasibility of intra-body electromagnetic (EM) nanoscale communication. This paper focuses on the modeling of communication channel noise inside the human heart wall at the THz frequency range (0.1-10 THz) and implements a noise model considering the radiation of the medium and the molecular absorption from the transmitted signal. Our simulation analysis shows that noise is frequency-dependent and temperature independent and according to our findings, the channel noise power spectral density at a scale of several micrometers is within acceptable bounds and the value is typically declining with a rise in both frequency and distance.
